var config = {
    modules: [
        {
            module: 'mmm-toggle-by-mqtt',
            position: 'fullscreen_below',
            config: {
                'mqttHost': 'mqtt://localhost',
                'mqttTopic': 'mmmToggleByMqtt'
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
NOTE: this module will not ship with an mqtt server, you have to install and run it manually.


## Using the module

* To show/hide all DOM elements, send command `show` or `hide` to the specified mqtt topic on the specified mqtt server.
* To show/hide a specific module, send command `MMM-my-module=show` or `MMM-my-module=hide` to the specified mqtt topic on the specified mqtt server.
* To turn the HDMI display on or off, send command `on` or `off` to the specified mqtt topic on the specified mqtt server.
    * This can be used to save energy, e.g. turn off display at night.
